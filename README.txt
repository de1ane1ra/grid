grid is a grid sketchpad. I will refrain from listing use cases and functionality for the time being, I imagine it will be more fun to experience this way.

grid is heavily inspired by Devine Lu Linvega & Rekka Bellum's collection of small, sharp tools.
Please support their work: https://100r.co, https://wiki.xxiivv.com, and https://kokorobot.ca.
Huge thanks to them for the inspiration.
